## üí≠ My Recommendation:

Since we've built SO MUCH already (40+ tasks!), I recommend:

**Option B + C: Database Integration + Testing**

**Why:**
1. You have a TON of UI built (6 complete phases!)
2. Testing with mock data can only go so far
3. Seeing real campaigns/clients will reveal what works
4. Forms can wait - you can manually enter Content Hub data for now
5. Database integration will make everything feel "real"
6. Then build Forms with real database (easier to test)

**Timeline:**
- Week 1: Database integration for Phases 1-6
- Week 2: Test, refine, fix bugs
- Week 3: Continue building (Forms, Scope, Flows)

---

## üìã What Database Integration Involves:

1. **Create SQL tables** (use `OPS_DATABASE_REQUIREMENTS.md`)
2. **Create API routes:**
   - `/api/ops/campaigns` (GET, POST, PATCH, DELETE)
   - `/api/ops/content` (brand links, files, notes, calls)
   - `/api/ops/activity` (activity log)
3. **Replace mock data with real queries**
4. **Add Supabase Storage** for campaign images & files
5. **Test everything end-to-end**

**Estimated:** 10-15 hours

## üöÄ Your Call!

**What would you like to do?**

**A. Continue Forms (Tasks 66-70)** - 8-10 more hours of UI building  
**B. Database Integration** - Make Phases 1-6 real and functional  
**C. Test & Polish** - Refine what we have  
**D. Other Phase** - Build Scope or Flows instead

I'm ready for any direction! What feels right? üéØ
