# üé® Demo Dashboard Setup

## Overview

The demo dashboard provides a **fully functional test environment** with realistic mock data for development, testing, and demonstrations - without requiring Klaviyo API access.

**Demo URL:** `http://localhost:3000/client/demo`

---

## üöÄ Quick Setup

### **Step 1: Run the SQL Script**

Open your **Supabase SQL Editor** and run:
```bash
database/create_demo_dashboard.sql
```

This creates:
- ‚úÖ 1 demo client (`brand_slug: demo`)
- ‚úÖ 20 realistic campaigns (last 60 days)
- ‚úÖ 5 flows with 8 weeks of performance data each
- ‚úÖ 60 days of revenue attribution metrics
- ‚úÖ 60 days of list growth data

### **Step 2: Access the Dashboard**

Navigate to:
```
http://localhost:3000/client/demo
```

**No authentication required** - the demo client is public for testing.

## üîß Customization

### **Update Demo Client Branding**
```sql
UPDATE clients 
SET 
  primary_color = '#your_color',
  secondary_color = '#your_color',
  portal_title = 'Custom Demo Title',
  logo_url = 'https://your-logo-url.com/logo.png'

```

### **Regenerate Data**
Simply re-run the SQL script to generate fresh random data with different values.

### **Add More Campaigns/Flows**

```sql
-- Change this line:
FOR campaign_num IN 1..20 LOOP  -- Increase to 50, 100, etc.
```

---

## üìã Data Validation

After running the script, verify data was created:
```sql
SELECT 
  'Campaigns' as type, COUNT(*) as count 
FROM campaign_metrics 
WHERE client_id = '00000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000001'
UNION ALL
SELECT 'Flow Messages', COUNT(*) 
FROM flow_message_metrics 
WHERE client_id = '00000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000001'
UNION ALL
SELECT 'Revenue Attribution', COUNT(*) 
FROM revenue_attribution_metrics 
WHERE client_id = '00000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000001'
UNION ALL
SELECT 'List Growth', COUNT(*) 
FROM list_growth_metrics 
WHERE client_id = '00000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000001';

## ‚ú® Pro Tip

**Combine with Hydrus client** for comprehensive testing:
- **Demo** (`/client/demo`) - Controlled mock data
- **Hydrus** (`/client/hydrus`) - Real Klaviyo integration
- **Safari** (`/client/safari`) - Production data

This gives you isolated environments for every testing scenario!
