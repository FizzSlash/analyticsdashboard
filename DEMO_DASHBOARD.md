- Check client exists: `SELECT * FROM clients WHERE brand_slug = 'demo';`

**No data showing in tabs:**
- Run verification query above to check data counts
- Check browser console for errors
- Verify timeframe selector is set appropriately

**Want to reset demo data:**
- Re-run the entire SQL script (it deletes and recreates everything)
