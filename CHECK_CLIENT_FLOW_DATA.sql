    üîç KEY FINDINGS TO CHECK:
    
    STEP 1: How much total data do you have?
    - If earliest_week_date is recent (e.g., April 2025) ‚Üí Only 6 months of data
    - If sum_conversion_value_field > 0 but sum_revenue_field = 0 ‚Üí Revenue in wrong column!
    
    STEP 2: Which timeframes return data?
    - If 7-90 days have data but 180-365 return 0 records ‚Üí Data only goes back a few months
    
    STEP 3: Which column has the revenue?
    - Look for "‚ö†Ô∏è ONLY conversion_value" ‚Üí Revenue is in conversion_value, not revenue
    
    STEP 4: Is weekly aggregation working?
    - Should show weeks with revenue summed up
    - If all zeros ‚Üí Field mapping issue
    
    STEP 5: What day do weeks start?
    - If day_of_week_number = 0 (Sunday) or 1 (Monday) ‚Üí Standard
    
    STEP 7: Which flows have revenue?
    - Compare total_revenue vs total_conversion
    
    STEP 8: When was last sync?
    - If NEVER SYNCED or STALE ‚Üí Need to run sync
    
    üí° MOST LIKELY ISSUES:
    1. Database only has April-October 2025 data (6 months, not 12)
    2. Revenue stored in conversion_value field, backend reads wrong one
    3. Week alignment mismatch between generated keys and database keys
