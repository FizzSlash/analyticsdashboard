    üîç Check the results above:
    
    STEP 1: Do you have data? Check earliest_week and latest_week
    STEP 2: Which timeframes return data? 
           - If 180/365 show NO DATA ‚Üí Database doesnt have old data
           - If 180/365 show DATA EXISTS BUT NO REVENUE ‚Üí Field mapping issue
    STEP 3: Is revenue stored in "revenue" or "conversion_value" field?
    STEP 4: What day of week do weeks start on? (0=Sunday, 1=Monday, etc)
    STEP 5: What actual data would backend return for 365 days?
    
    üéØ LIKELY ISSUES:
    1. Database only has recent data (last 6 months) ‚Üí 365 day query returns nothing
    2. Revenue stored in wrong field ‚Üí Backend reads wrong column
    3. Week alignment mismatch ‚Üí Date keys dont match
