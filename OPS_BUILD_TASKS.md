---

## üöÄ Let's Start!

**Ready to begin with Task 1?**

I'll create the basic `/ops` route with a styled page that matches your portal design. Just say "Start Task 1" and I'll build it!

**Questions before we start:**
1. Route name: `/ops` or `/team`? (I recommend `/ops`)
2. Any specific clients you want in the mock data besides Hydrus, Peak Design, and Make Waves?
3. Should I use your existing clients from the database for mock data?
